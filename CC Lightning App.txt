Certainly! Let's walk through a step-by-step guide to design and develop a custom **Event Management Application** using Salesforce Cloud. This guide will help you build a functional application to manage events, registrations, feedback, and reporting.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Develop a custom Event Management Application on the Salesforce Platform to streamline event creation, attendee registration, feedback collection, and post-event analytics.

---

## 🛠️ **Prerequisites**

* Salesforce Developer Edition account
* Familiarity with Salesforce Lightning Experience
* Basic understanding of Salesforce Objects, Fields, and Relationships
* Knowledge of Salesforce Automation Tools (Process Builder, Flow)
* Optional: Apex programming for advanced customization

---

## 🧱 **Step 1: Set Up Your Salesforce Environment**

1. **Sign Up for a Developer Account**:

   * Visit [Salesforce Developer](https://developer.salesforce.com/signup) and create a free account.

2. **Log In to Salesforce**:

   * Access your Developer Edition at [login.salesforce.com](https://login.salesforce.com).

---

## 🗂️ **Step 2: Create Custom Objects**

We'll create three custom objects: **Event**, **Attendee**, and **Feedback**.

1. **Event Object**:

   * Navigate to **Setup** > **Object Manager** > **Create** > **Custom Object**.
   * Label: `Event`
   * Object Name: `Event__c`
   * Fields:

     * Event Name (Text)
     * Date (Date)
     * Location (Text)
     * Description (Long Text Area)
     * Organizer (Text)

2. **Attendee Object**:

   * Label: `Attendee`
   * Object Name: `Attendee__c`
   * Fields:

     * Name (Text)
     * Email (Email)
     * Event (Lookup to Event)
     * Registered (Checkbox)

3. **Feedback Object**:

   * Label: `Feedback`
   * Object Name: `Feedback__c`
   * Fields:

     * Attendee (Lookup to Attendee)
     * Event (Lookup to Event)
     * Rating (Number)
     * Comments (Long Text Area)

---

## 🎨 **Step 3: Design Lightning Pages**

1. **Event Record Page**:

   * Use the **Lightning App Builder** to customize the Event record page.
   * Add related lists for Attendees and Feedback.([support.clickandpledge.com][1], [https://s2-labs.com/][2])

2. **Attendee Registration Page**:

   * Create a **Lightning App Page** for attendee registration.
   * Use standard components or custom Lightning components to build the registration form.

3. **Feedback Submission Page**:

   * Design a page where attendees can submit feedback post-event.

---

## 🔄 **Step 4: Automate Processes**

1. **Attendee Registration Confirmation**:

   * Use **Process Builder** or **Flow Builder** to send a confirmation email when an attendee registers.

2. **Feedback Reminder**:

   * Set up a **Scheduled Flow** to send feedback reminders to attendees after the event date.

---

## 📊 **Step 5: Create Reports and Dashboards**

1. **Reports**:

   * Total Events Organized
   * Number of Attendees per Event
   * Average Feedback Rating per Event([360 Degree Cloud][3])

2. **Dashboards**:

   * Visual representations of the above reports for quick insights.

---

## 🧪 **Step 6: Test the Application**

1. **Create Sample Events**:

   * Add a few events with different dates and locations.

2. **Register Attendees**:

   * Use the registration page to add attendees to events.

3. **Submit Feedback**:

   * After event dates, submit feedback for testing purposes.

4. **Verify Automations**:

   * Ensure confirmation emails and feedback reminders are sent as configured.

---

## ✅ **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you've built a custom Event Management Application on Salesforce that handles event creation, attendee registration, feedback collection, and reporting. This application can be further enhanced with features like payment integration, QR code check-ins, and more, depending on your requirements.
